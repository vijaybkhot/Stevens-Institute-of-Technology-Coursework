Questions:
Each question carries 25 points and total points is 100.

1. Complete the method `calculateHypotenuse(double side1, double side2)` that calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the other two sides. Using the `Math` class, the result should be rounded to two decimal places.
Example 1:
Input: calculateHypotenuse(3.0, 4.0) Output: 5.0
Example 2:
Input: calculateHypotenuse(5.0, 12.0) Output: 13.0


2.
Complete the method `convertCharacterCase(char inputChar)` that returns the converted character: if the input character is lowercase, it should return its uppercase equivalent; if it's uppercase, it should return its lowercase version. If it's neither, it should return the original character.
Example 1:
Input: convertCharacterCase('a') Output: 'A'
Example 2:
Input: convertCharacterCase('Z') Output: 'z'
Example 3:
Input: convertCharacterCase('1') Output: '1'


3.
Complete the method `reverseString(String input)` that returns the reversed version of the given string.
Example 1:
Input: reverseString("hello") Output: "olleh"
Example 2:
Input: reverseString("Java") Output: "avaJ"
Example 3:
Input: reverseString("OpenAI") Output: "IAnepO"


4.
Complete the method `sumFirstTenFibonacci()` that calculates and returns the summation of the first 10 Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence starts with the numbers 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Use loops to compute the sum.
